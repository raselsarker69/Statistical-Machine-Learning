<h1>Prerequisites for Sorting Numbers</h1>
<p>Before diving into sorting techniques, ensure youâ€™re familiar with Python and its list data structure. Lists in Python are ideal for managing and organizing numerical data. Hereâ€™s a quick overview:</p>

    # Example List of Numbers
    list1 = [30, 100, 5, 7, 200, 2, 10, 55, 24]

In the list, all the elements are numaricals

<h1>Here I will show how to sort a list in multiple ways</h1>

<h2>Method 1: Using the sorted() Function</h2>
 <p>The sorted() function is a built-in Python tool for sorting any iterable, including number lists. By default, sorted() arranges elements in ascending order. And when I To sort in descending order, set the       reverse parameter to True.</p>

    # Example List of Numbers
    list1 = [30, 100, 5, 7, 200, 2, 10, 55, 24]
    
    # 1. Ascending Order using `sorted()`
    ascending_sorted = sorted(list1)
    print("Ascending Order:", ascending_sorted)
    
    # 2. Descending Order using `sorted()`
    descending_sorted = sorted(list1, reverse=True)
    print("Descending Order:", descending_sorted)
    
  
<br>
<br>
<h2>Method 2: Using the sort() method</h2>
    
    # 1. Ascending Order using `sort()`
    list1.sort()
    print("Ascending Order:", list1)
    list1 = [30, 100, 5, 7, 200, 2, 10, 55, 24]
    
    # 2. Descending Order using `sort()`
    list1.sort(reverse=True)
    print("Descending Order:", list1)

<br>
<br>
<h2>Method 3: Using the [::-1] slicing technique</h2>
<p>The [::-1] slicing technique is a quick way to reverse the order of elements in a list. While it doesnâ€™t actually sort the list, it can be combined with sorting functions to create a reversed sorted list. For example, you can use sorted(list1)[::-1] to achieve a descending order without modifying the original list.</p>

    # Original List
    list1 = [30, 100, 5, 7, 200, 2, 10, 55, 24]
    
    # Step 1: ascending order
    ascending_sorted = sorted(list1)
    print("Ascending Order:", ascending_sorted)
    
    # Step 2: slicing to reverse the sorted list (Descending Order)
    descending_sorted = ascending_sorted[::-1]
    print("Descending Order using slicing:", descending_sorted)

<br>
<br>
<h2>Method 4: Using the Lambda Function with sorted()</h2>
    
    # Original List
    list1 = [30, 100, 5, 7, 200, 2, 10, 55, 24]
    
    # Sorting based on the last digit using lambda
    sorted_by_last_digit = sorted(list1, key=lambda x: x % 10)
    print("Sorted by Last Digit:", sorted_by_last_digit)


## Explanation

- The `key` parameter in `sorted()` specifies a function that extracts a comparison key from each list element.
- In this example, `lambda x: x % 10` is used to extract the last digit of each number as the key.
- The list is then sorted based on these last digits.

<h2>Please read some more important Python questions</h2>

1. **What is Python?**
   - Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language.

2. **What is `__init__`?**
   - `__init__` is an instance method that initializes a newly created object.

3. **What is the `__str__` method in Python?**
   - The `__str__` method represents class objects as strings, often used for easier representation.

4. **What is the use of `self` in Python?**
   - `self` represents the instance of the class, used to access instance variables and methods.

5. **What are decorators, and how are they used in Python?**
   - Decorators modify or extend the behavior of functions without changing their actual code.

6. **What are `*args` and `**kwargs`?**
   - `*args`: Allows a function to accept any number of positional arguments, stored as a tuple.
   - `**kwargs`: Allows a function to accept any number of keyword arguments, stored as a dictionary.

7. **If a function doesnâ€™t have a return statement, is it valid in Python?**
   - Yes, the function implicitly returns `None`.

8. **Differentiate between instance and class variables.**
   - Class variables are shared across all instances, whereas instance variables are unique to each instance.

9. **What is the difference between `/` and `//` in Python?**
   - `/` performs floating-point division (e.g., `5 / 2 = 2.5`).
   - `//` performs floor division, returning an integer (e.g., `5 // 2 = 2`).

10. **What is a List?**
    - A list is a mutable, ordered collection of items in Python, defined with `[]`.

11. **What is a Tuple?**
    - A tuple is an immutable, ordered collection of items in Python, defined with `()`.

12. **What is a Dictionary?**
    - A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs in Python, defined with `{}`.

13. **What is a Set?**
    - A set is an unordered collection of unique elements in Python, defined with `{}` or `set()`.

14. **Difference Between Lists and Tuples in Python?**
    - Lists are mutable and slower but flexible, while tuples are immutable, making them faster and fixed.
